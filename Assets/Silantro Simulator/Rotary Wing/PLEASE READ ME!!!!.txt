Before opening any of the sample scenes please do the following

1. Setup Input from the menu >> Oyedoyin/Rotary Wing/Misc/Setup Input

2. Create the following layers in the following order
	a. Ground - Layer 8
	b. Aircraft - Layer 9
	c. Human - Layer 10
	d. Munition - Layer 11

3. Disable the following collision in the physics settings
	a. Aircraft-Munition
	b. Aircraft-Human
	c. Aircraft-Aircraft
	d. Munition-Human
	e. Munition-Munition

4. a. Move all the aircraft colliders to the "Aircraft" layer
   b. Move the "Hardpoint" gameobject in the aircraft (Only for weapon enabled aircrafts) to the "Munition" layer
   c. Move the Bullet/Rocket/Bomb and Missile prefabs to the "Munition" layer
   d. Move the Players/Player prefabs and Pilot gameobjects to the "Human" layer

Note: Some of these should be done automatically, but its always better to double check


5. For maximum accuracy and smoothness of controls, Joystick or Console controller input is recommended.

To use Keyboard inputs, you'll have to slightly adjust the Sensitivity and Gravity of each axis key mapping.
e.g 

A. For Low Fidelity Helicopters
Roll Sensitivity = 2f
Roll Gravity = 0.35f

Pitch Sensitivity = 2.1f;
Pitch Gravity = 0.4f

B. For High Fidelity Helicopters
Roll Sensitivity = 2f
Roll Gravity = 1f

Pitch Sensitivity = 2.1f;
Pitch Gravity = 1f
