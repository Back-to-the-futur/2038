For maximum accuracy and smoothness of controls, Joystick or Console controller input is recommended.

To use Keyboard inputs, you'll have to slightly adjust the Sensitivity and Gravity of each axis key mapping.
e.g 

A. For Low Fidelity Helicopters
Roll Sensitivity = 2f
Roll Gravity = 0.35f

Pitch Sensitivity = 2.1f;
Pitch Gravity = 0.4f

B. For High Fidelity Helicopters
Roll Sensitivity = 2f
Roll Gravity = 1f

Pitch Sensitivity = 2.1f;
Pitch Gravity = 1f
